# GoogleCardboardGameDemo
A one Level example of google cardboard game. 

Compatible with Unity 5.3.5f1

Make sure to switch build to android.
May need to re-bake lights to look like photo. Go to the lighting tab next to inspector and at the bottom hit build. 

How to play in Unity Editor:
Hold the 'option' key and move the mouse to look around. Click the mouse to move. The Object of the game is to find the "power barrels" and bring them back to the center pad starting point. Beware the Generator Bots patrolling.
